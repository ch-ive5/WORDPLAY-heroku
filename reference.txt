INTERMEDIATE SYNSET ID ASSIGNMENT
synset_id: 'x00000000'  # First character is part of speech.  # Last 8 characters is the wordnet synset number.
    pos (part of speech): 'n', 'v', 'a', 's', 'r' (noun, verb, adjective, adjective satellite, adverb)
        # Adjective satellite 's' used by wordnet, but converted to and merged with adjective 'a' in this project.
